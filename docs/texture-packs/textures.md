# Textures

The following format is used when adding textures:

`[root]/[modId]/[cellId].png`

`[root]` is the folder in which the `icon.png` and `texturepack.json` files are stored.

Default `modId`s and `cellId`s can be found [here](/architecture/core/cell-type#default-cell-types).

## Cell Texture Constraints

- the image must have square dimensions
- the size of the image should be a power of 2
- the image has to be in `.png` format
